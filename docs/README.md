# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. It provides a single place to find the project lifecycle, role definitions, checklists, and templates that teams use to initiate, plan, execute, release, and continuously improve work.

Overview
OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, repeatable lifecycle: Initiation (validate and authorize work with a Project One‑pager), Planning (break work into shippable backlog items, define acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, create a release plan), Execution & Tracking (use a project board and disciplined PR/CI workflows to implement and verify work), Release & Deployment (checklists, smoke tests, rollback plans, and post‑deploy verification), and Retrospective & Continuous Improvement (capture learnings and convert them into tracked action items). Roles are explicit—Product Managers (define outcomes and prioritize), Project Managers (coordinate delivery and risks), Developers (implement and test), QA/Testing (validate acceptance criteria), and Stakeholders (provide input and approvals). Quality assurance is embedded via unit/integration tests, CI gating, security scans, and manual QA where needed.
